Event loop
===========

*Call Stack, *web apis, *callback queue, *microtask queue, *Event loop

*call stack -> executes function in a last-in , first-out order.
*Web apis -> Handles Async task like (setTimeout, DOM APi, fetch, localStorage, console, location)
*callback queue -> stores functions that need to run after Async task completed.
*microtask queue -> Handles high - proirity task like Promises.
Event loop -> Moves tasks from the queue to the call stack, when it's empty.
